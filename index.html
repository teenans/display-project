            Indian culture is the heritage of social norms, ethical values, traditional customs,
            belief systems, political systems, artifacts and technologies that originated in or
            are associated with the Indian subcontinent. The term also applies beyond India to
            countries and cultures whose histories are strongly connected to India by immigration,
            colonization, or influence, particularly in South Asia and Southeast Asia.
            India's languages, religions, dance, music, architecture, food and customs differ from
            place to place within the country.

        <p>India is the birthplace of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, and
            other religions. They are collectively known as Indian religions.
            Indian religions are a major form of world religions along with
            Abrahamic ones. Today, Hinduism and Buddhism are the world's third and
            fourth-largest religions respectively, with over 2 billion followers
            altogether, and possibly as many as 2.5 or 2.6 billion followers.
